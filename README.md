### Hello ✌️

### 😺 HOW IT WORKS 😺

- 😺it consists of taking points as a reference and making such an object walk to them
- 😺 the number of points is unlimited
- 😺in it you can define things like the object's speed, what point it will be born, how far it will touch the point
- 😺 it contains a patch that must be defined as the object so that it can move from one point to another
